# What is Linux

Linux kernel has just past its 32nd birthday. In many devices, including web servers, smartphones, electric cars, and of course on Steam Decks, you can find Linux.

Linux is an operating system *kernel*. Kernel means "core; central part" in English. Linux on itself can only respond to hardware events; there are no ways to interact with the Linux kernel directly.

People bundle software (browsers, file managers, etc.) together with the Linux kernel to form a functional operating system. Many different people and companies bundle various software with Linux, each coming with their own configurations (wallpapers, theme, etc.) Various "flavors" of the Linux operating system, or *Linux distributions*, are thus created.

Today, we will help you to install a Linux distribution on your computer. You can choose Ubuntu, one of the most popular Linux distributions; or choose FOCS Debian, a Debian-based distribution which is developed by and for fellow JIers. Also you can choose other distributions.

# Benefits of having a Linux system

- Survive 151, 280, 482 and other JI courses without having to worry about configuring your system
- More control of your computer; no disturbing desktop ads anymore, no worrying about Big Brother watching you ;)
- A bonus point on your resume that can help you find a job
- Most importantly... Linux is fun!

# Ways to get a Linux system

- Use Windows Subsystem on Linux - WSL
- Use a virtual machine 
- Install a dual boot system
- Only use Linux on your computer

---
# Administering a Linux system

Linux is pretty much designed around a command-line shell. A _shell_ is a program that interacts with the operating system _kernel_: you issue commands via the shell, and the OS does it for you. In order to master Linux, some basic shell knowledge is necessary.

# Alternatives of common Windows tools

1. Install by the App Store provided by your distribution, or
2. Use CLI to control the package manager

- Chrome, Edge, 360 Browser ... -> Firefox, Chromium

- Microsoft Office -> LibreOffice, WPS Office

- Chinese Input Method -> `ibus` (easier to configure, bundled with Ubuntu by default), `fcitx5` (more powerful and more features)
